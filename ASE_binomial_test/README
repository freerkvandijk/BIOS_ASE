For each gene calculate the binominal p-value with 
    Rscript binom_test.R
This makes for every gene a file with per individual the p-values for that gene. Includes both nominal, FDR, and bonferonni corrected p-values.



For ASE per sample with the annonymized data
    Rscript binom_sample_ASE_test.R

For each aggregated SNP calculate the binom p-value
    Rscript binom_snp_aggregate_test.R
